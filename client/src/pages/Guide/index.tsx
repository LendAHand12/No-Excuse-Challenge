            <p className="">
              DreamChain is built for dreamers and doers—those who have the
              vision to achieve greatness and the drive to make it happen.
              Membership is entirely voluntary, with no pressure or obligation
              to join. When a new member joins DreamChain, they contribute 100
              USDT, which is distributed as follows:
            </p>
            <ul className="grid gap-4">

                  <span className="font-semibold">1. Direct Commission:</span>{' '}
                  The person who recruits the new member receives 15 USDT as a
                  direct commission.
